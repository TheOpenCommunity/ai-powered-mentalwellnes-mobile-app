# MeWellAI

**MeWellAI** an AI powered mobile app for mental wellness.

I'm [Ibrohim Abdivokhidov](https://abdibrokhim.vercel.app/about) the Founder of **MeWellAI**.

How did I come up with the idea? Initially I brainstormed tons of ideas. From Telegram chatbots to Web app chatbot. However I knew people used to use different social apps. So, I thought why not build a social media type app for mental wellness.

Then I started to draft the notes and ideas.

**Original notes from brainstorming (not edited):**

Agents or Agent <=> AI mental wellness professionals.

**Initial phase:**

I am thinking of making it like a social media app. There will be specific Agents for specific mental illnesses. 

For example: 
- Emotional Well-being: Managing emotions, coping with stress, and developing emotional resilience
- Social Well-being: Building and maintaining healthy relationships, social connections, and a sense of community
- Psychological Well-being: Developing a positive self-image, self-acceptance, and self-esteem
- Physical Well-being: Taking care of one‚Äôs physical health, which can have a positive impact on mental well-being

All of the Agents will interact with the user as a real mental wellness person.

Users may chat with Agents, connect with them the same as on LinkedIn.

**Next iterations:**

- Users may follow the Agents. Like the posts, comment their thoughts, and share on other socials. 

- Agents will post different posts related to their background autonomously. For example: Emotional Well-being Agent may post short about how to manage emotions in different situations. And etc.

- Book live sessions with Agents and talk with them. Real time (streaming).


**Info:**

- Mental wellness is more self-directed, relying on personal agency and self-care practices.
- Mental wellness takes a salutogenic approach focused on promoting positive human functioning and optimal well-being.

Cool! I have a clear vision of the app.

I named it **MeWellAI**. I love minimalism and simplicity. So, I decided to make the app *UI (User Interface)* as simple as possible. And pay more attention to the *UX (User Experience)* to make it predictable and intuitive.

Quickly I started to build and iterate the app.

Here is the initial version 0.0.0 of **MeWellAI**.

#### Why Redux?
Use Flutter's `ValueNotifier` or `ChangeNotifier`: These classes provide a simpler way to manage state and can be more efficient than using Redux for small to medium-sized apps. Have you noticed? *small to medium-sized apps*. However, for larger apps, or apps that need to share a lot of state between different parts of the app, `Redux` can be a good choice. *So, I chose Redux for MeWellAI. I'm building a cool and massive mobile application.*

### How MeWellAI may benefit humanity (YOU)? üí´

**In short:**

- People used to use different social apps. Building social media type app for mental wellness will benefit user experience.

- Specific Agents for specific mental illnesses. It makes an agent even more professional in that field.

- Features such as profile, likes, comments, shares, connections, follow are the centric part of any social media app. Plays crucial role for maintaining user engagement over time, encouraging continuous support and follow-up.

- Will use `OpenAI‚Äôs gpt4o` model that makes contextually appropriate and empathetic responses.

- Will use `D-ID APIs` for live sessions. Users can talk to Agents in a live (streaming API).


## Profit üí∞
- **MeWellAI** will be a freemium app. Users may use the app for free.
- From courses and training.
- From live sessions.
- From ads (only mental wellness) that will be smoothly integrated into the different feeds. User will NOT feel like they are watching ads.
- Subscription model for accessing a broader range of agents.
