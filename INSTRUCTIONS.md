## How to Use MeWellAI? 👀

**A very quick intro**

After running the app, you can either sign in with the following credentials (if you need pre-populated data such as chat history with different agents and etc.):

```
email: testO1@gmail.com
password: testO1@gmail.com
```

Or you can create a new account and sign in.

**Note:** If can't sign up, pleas use the above credentials to sign in. Send me message or feedback at [abdibrokhim@gmail.com](mailto:abdibrokhim@gmail.com) if you need any help.

Once you have created an account, you may start exploring MeWellAI features.

### Sign In or Sign Up
You may sign in or sign up to MeWellAI using your email and password or Google. When you choose to sign up, pleas write yout first name, last name, email, and password. On click sign up you will be redirecter to sign in screen. Now you may enter your email and password to sign in. Google sign in may not work. I tested it it worked fine for me.

### Explore and Search Agents
After signing in, you may start exploring different mental health agents or search for the specific mental health agents. The Explore screen has a Search bar on the top center. And List of agents right below the search bar. Agents are sorted by rating and number of conversations. You may click on any agent to view the agent profile. Usually they will be listed in a separate section below the search bar, for example: Top rated agents for today, Most active agents for today, and etc.

### Agent Profile
On clicking a specific agent, it will open the agent's comprehensive profile. You may read the agent name, short bio, list of skills, rating (average calculated from all rated users), number of conversations (opened chats between user and agent), conversation starters (already prepared questions for quick dive into topic), and start chat (start from blank chat). On clicking the arrow back on the top left corner, you will be navigated back either to the Explore screen (initial app screen and starting point of the app) or Mainlayout screen (if you click one of two top rated listed agents below the search bar).

### Start Chat
Here you may also start a chat with one of the conversation starters (located above input field). On the top right corner, there is a vertical ellipsis (three dots) button. On click, it will open the small bottom sheet with the following options: put rating to the chat and agent, delete chat. On the top center agent image and name. On clicking the top left arrow you will be navigated to the Agent Profile screen. On the bottom right corner, there is a send button. And on the bottom left corner, there is a plus button for adding attachments (e.g., images and files). Chats are aligned left only. Both user and agent messages are aligned left with profile image and name following the message. You may start chatting with one of the conversation starters.

### Mainlayout screen
Drawer with the following features: Search bar, List of (limited 2) top rated and most active agents (sorted by rating and number of conversations), user recent chats, Explore, and Profile. You may click on any agent and start a chat. Or you may dive in the recent chat and continue the conversation. On long press on the recent chat, it will open the bottom sheet with the following options: edit chat title or choose from the list of generated cool titles and delete chat. On click the Explore, it will navigate to the Explore screen. On clicking the Profile, it will navigate to the user Profile screen.

### Search bar (Mainlayout screen)
Search bar is located on the very top of the Drawer, before the List of top rated and most active agents. You may use the search bar to search for the specific chat from the recent chats.

### User Profile
User profile is really simple (for now). There are three vertical dots on the top right corner. On click, it will open the bottom sheet with the following options: send feedback and sign out. At the center of the screen, there is a user profile image, name, and email. Below there is a General note that is valid during the app usage. On clicking the burger menu (three horizontal lines) on the top left corner, it will open the Mainlayout screen.
